<p style="color:#990000; font-weight:bold; font-size:x-large">Full-Wave Bridge Rectifier</p>

    <p>
        This is a model of a power supply that converts 120 volts AC to 12 volts DC. The transformer has a turns<BR>
        ratio of 14, stepping the supply down to 8.6 volts rms, i.e. 8.6*sqrt(2) = 12 volts pk-pk. The full-wave <BR>
        bridge rectifier plus capacitor combination then converts this to DC. The resistor represents a typical <BR>
        load.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The model can be used to size the capacitor required for a specified load. For a given size of capacitor, <BR>
        as the load resistance is increased, the ripple on the DC voltage increases. The model can also be used <BR>
        to drive an application circuit in order to assess the effect of the ripple.
